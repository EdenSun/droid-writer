#DroidWriter usage

= Usage =

The project is still in an early phase, so currently the only way to use it is to check it out with svn, and use it as an Android Library project.


Once you linked the DroidWriter lib with your project, you can simply use the DroidWriter widget in a layout file, e.g.:

<com.android.droidwriter.DroidWriter android:id="@+id/DroidWriter"
    	android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    	android:layout_width="fill_parent" />
